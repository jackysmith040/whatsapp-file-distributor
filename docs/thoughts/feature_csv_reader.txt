Thoughts:
    I want to streamline the process of mapping keywords to the files.
    I want to add a feauture that let's us place a simple csv file that contains the keyword and files. It should read the columns and structure it to fit the current config python dictionary.
    
Current Design:
    There's a config python file that contains a dictionary with key and value keywords -> files.

Idea Workflow:
    1. Loads the csv file, (make sure it's in the same directory as the config.py)
    2. Reads the columns it's values
    3. Makes sure the data structure of the csv matches the config.

Desing Choice:
    A very simple OOP. I was thinking we can use a dataclass for the attributes and just use a a class as a container to group csv helper methods.
    But i'll just go for a simple OOP design with simple methods.

In the config.py 
The mapping rule is:
    ---code
    # Maps keywords to a LIST of target groups.
    RULE_MAPPING = [
        {
            "keywords": ["system", "dynamical"],
            "target_groups": ["iampeace"],
        },
        {
            "keywords": ["end"],
            "target_groups": ["iampeace"],
        },
    ]
    ---end
