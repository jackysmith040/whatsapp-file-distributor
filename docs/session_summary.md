# Session Summaries

This file contains summaries of our development sessions to ensure long-term context persistence.

### **Session: 2025-09-19**
**Director's Goal:** Implement feature F-04 (Prioritized Sending) with a robust, modular design.
**Key Decisions Made:**
- Refactored the feature's architecture to adhere strictly to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Created a dedicated `FileSorter` class to handle all sorting logic.
- Enhanced the `DispatcherController` to "hydrate" the queue with file sizes and handle `FileNotFoundError` gracefully before the sorting and sending phases.
**Artifacts Modified/Created:**
- `src/core/sorter.py` (new file)
- `src/core/dispatcher.py` (updated)
- `main.py` (updated)
- `docs/tracking/tasks.md` (updated)
**Open Questions/Next Steps:** Proceed with the next development task, F-05 (WhatsApp Dispatch Engine).

### **Session: 2025-09-16**
**Director's Goal:** Initialize the project structure.
**Key Decisions Made:** Established the core documentation (PRD, Task Tracker, Session Summary) using the MfGA framework.
**Artifacts Modified/Created:** docs/prd.md, docs/tracking/tasks.md, docs/session_summary.md.
**Open Questions/Next Steps:** Proceed with the first development task (F-01) from the PRD.

### **Session: 2025-09-17**
**Director's Goal:** Implement feature F-02 (Interactive Workspace Selection) and refine project structure.
**Key Decisions Made:**
- Adopted a formal Spec->Implement->Document workflow.
- Implemented F-02 using an object-oriented approach (FolderReader class) and a Service Locator pattern.
- Refined the project architecture by moving `main.py` to the root directory.
- Improved `config.py` to be platform-independent by using `pathlib.Path.home()`.
**Artifacts Modified/Created:**
- `docs/system-logic/f02-interactive-workspace-selection.md`
- `src/core/file_handler.py`
- `src/core/__init__.py`
- `main.py` (relocated and updated)
- `config.py` (refactored)
- `docs/tracking/tasks.md` (updated)
**Open Questions/Next Steps:** Proceed with the next development task (F-03).

### **Session: 2025-09-17**
**Director's Goal:** Implement feature F-03 (Automated Discovery & Queuing).
**Key Decisions Made:**
- Refined the F-03 implementation to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle by separating discovery and queuing logic.
- Improved the `FolderReader` class by updating its type hints to accept `str | Path`, making it more versatile.
**Artifacts Modified/Created:**
- `src/core/file_handler.py` (updated)
- `main.py` (updated)
- `docs/tracking/tasks.md` (updated)
**Open Questions/Next Steps:** Proceed with the next development task (F-04).
